## üß† About Me

I'm a developer and competitive programmer with a love for mathematics. I enjoy solving overly complex problems optimizing little things such as PST on HLD with FFT implemented by NTT with CRT to maintain CHT calculating MCF for MCC with SCC on MST using BIT to store LCT and D&C on KMP on FPS to optimize SAM for BCC evaluating PIE why is there CHT twice based on ODT with GHT maintaining KDT to calculate MVC, MBM, and MIS on LIS-SOS induced graph with ETT and CZT on each node with SEC on each hyperplane to do ILP on a SBT with CPP instances using PHP optimized by PBS using HMT, with LCP on WMI as universe done with MPM to maintain AAT with OST on RSA numbers for WBG-EGT counting on TCC of resulting TCP for RBT with IST on each node to do EST for DLX with PET pruning and using that to learn about PST on HLD with FFT implemented by NTT with CRT to maintain CHT calculating MCF for MCC with SCC on MST using BIT to store LCT and D&C on KMP on FPS to optimize SAM for BCC evaluating PIE why is there CHT twice based on ODT with GHT maintaining KDT to calculate MVC, MBM, and MIS on LIS-SOS induced graph with ETT and CZT on each node with SEC on each hyperplane to do ILP on a SBT with CPP instances using PHP optimized by PBS using HMT, with LCP on WMI as universe done with MPM to maintain AAT with OST on RSA numbers for WBG-EGT counting on TCC of resulting TCP for RBT with IST on each node to do EST for DLX with PET pruning
